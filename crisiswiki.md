# crisis wiki

(seeing as crisiswiki.org is already a thing http://crisiswiki.org/Main_Page we need a new name. crisiswiki is just an instance of mediawiki which i dont think is the best tool for a crisis)
- breakingwiki
- wikicrisis.org?

## a wiki
- based around atoms
-each atom is a separate paragraph of text, an image file, a tweet, an item in a list, etc
-anonymous can add atoms, but not edit or remove
-authenticated users can add edit or remove
-each atom has its own edit history and can be diffed
-every user who has ever touched an atom is tracked on an editor list
-deleted atoms are tombstoned and can be viewed in a (publically accessible) audit mode

## users are organized around webs of trust
- users can verify themselves via pgp and or twitter (post verification message, a la keybase?)
- users can track people they trust
- visual indication of if atoms come from trusted, untrusted, bad-trusted, or anonymous editors (or a combination)
- users can bad-trust another user but must cite a publicly visible reason why.

## new crises can be created under the crisiswiki.org site.
- urls like crisiswiki.org/crisis/page

traffic will be hella spiky so it needs to scale

some sort of real-time feed page for news junkies

## super quick to make small contributions
- design elements and copy on page to encourage viewers to be contributors. track this as a key metric.

## new wikis are created with stub pages for basic outline:
- who what why where when
- best sources for latest info (usually twitter i guess)

## license
- all info dedicated to public domain / cc-0
